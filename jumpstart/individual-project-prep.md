# 💡 Getting Ready for Your Individual Project

Transform your idea into a compelling one-slide presentation

**🎯 The Challenge:** A successful project starts with a clear, compelling idea. Your task is to distill your concept into a single, powerful slide that captures the essence of what you want to build.

## 📋 Part 1: The One-Slide Presentation

Create a **single slide** about your project idea that you'll present to your group. Think of it as a one-page poster or PowerPoint slide that tells the complete story of your concept.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Your slide should be visually engaging and communicate your idea at a glance. Use images, diagrams, or mockups to make your concept tangible.

## 📝 Part 2: Written Project Description

Complement your slide with a written explanation that provides context and detail. This text should expand on what your slide presents and address the following key questions:

**Essential Questions to Address**

* **Main Goal:** What is the primary purpose of your application? What problem does it solve or what need does it fulfill?
* **Target Users:** Who are the main users of your application? What are their characteristics and needs?
* **Similar Applications:** Which existing applications does your concept resemble? What can you learn from these examples?

## 🔄 Feedback & Iteration

Your idea will benefit from diverse perspectives! **Actively seek feedback** from fellow students both inside and outside your group. This collaborative approach will help you refine and strengthen your concept.

**⚠️ Remember:** Great ideas evolve through discussion and iteration. Be open to suggestions and ready to refine your concept based on the feedback you receive.

## 📤 What to Deliver

Prepare both:

* Your one-slide presentation (PowerPoint or PDF)
* Your written project description document

You can then reference these in your portfolio as early evidence for your Individual Project planning.
