# Welcome to Software Design & Engineering!

The first day of the semester is all about introductions and an overview of what to expect in the coming weeks.

## Kick-Off by the Semester Coordinator

We will start with a **Kick-Off session**, where the semester coordinator will explain the structure of this semester. You will get insights into:

* The setup of the semester and the projects
* What is expected from you as a student
* How to prepare yourself for a successful semester

 **📚 Useful Links:** 
 * [Introduction - Software Design & Engineering](../course-info/overview.md)
 * [Introduction to Learning Outcomes](../learning-outcomes/overview.md)
 * [Planning of Software Design & Engineering](../portfolio/review-iterations.md)

## Getting to Know Your Semester Coach

After the Kick-Off, you will meet your **semester coach** and fellow students. This is an important moment to get to know your coach, ask questions, and understand how the guidance during the semester will work.

 **🎯 Essential Pages to Review:** 
 * [How do I get assessed?](../course-info/assessment.md)
 * [Creating a Portfolio](../portfolio/creating-a-portfolio.md)
 * [Feedback](../skills/professional/feedback.md)
 * FAQ (to be added locally if needed)

**📋 Note:** Your semester coach might be scheduled later in the week and may not be available on the first day. In that case, another lecturer will step in, or the introduction will take place later in the week.
