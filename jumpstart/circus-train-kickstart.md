# 🎪 Circus Train Kickstart Challenge

Get coding fast, avoid analysis paralysis, and jumpstart your semester

**🚀 Why This Challenge?**  
The Circus Train Kickstart Challenge is designed to get you coding immediately in the first 2-3 weeks. Instead of getting stuck in analysis paralysis on your big individual project, you'll dive straight into software development and potentially experience the entire software development process in miniature.

This challenge serves as your semester jumpstart – **the assignment doesn't need to be perfect or complete**. The goal is to prevent the dreaded scenario where you spend weeks overthinking analysis and never actually start building anything.

## 🎯 Choose Your Path

Pick one of these two approaches **in consultation with your teacher**. Explain your choice and reasoning.

### Option 1: Full Software Development Sprint

Rush through all components of the S2 Software Development process in just two weeks. This gives you valuable insight into what's expected throughout the semester and helps you identify your strengths and learning gaps early.

#### The Sprint Steps:

1. **Analysis:** Define requirements, create use cases, build a domain model
2. **Design:** Create system architecture and class diagrams
3. **Implementation:** Write clean, well-structured code
4. **Testing:** Validate with unit tests and integration tests
5. **Delivery & Reflection:** Deploy and gather feedback

**📘 Benefits:** You'll quickly identify which areas need more attention and can use this insight to plan your individual project strategically.

### Option 2: Code-First Approach

If you're still building confidence with coding, focus primarily on the programming aspects. Use your existing knowledge from semester 1 to solve the algorithmic problem as elegantly as possible.

#### The Focus Areas:

* Clean, readable code using solid programming principles
* Problem-solving with algorithms and data structures
* Regular discussion with teachers about progress and challenges
* Reflection on learning and growth throughout the process

**💡 Benefits:** Build coding confidence first, then reflect later in the semester on how much you've learned and improved.

## 🎪 The Challenge: Circus Train Algorithm

The classic circus train problem – an algorithmic challenge that combines logical thinking with practical programming skills.

### The Story

Circus director Hans needs to transport animals by train to new homes. With expensive wagon rentals, he needs optimal animal distribution while keeping everyone safe.

### Requirements

#### Animal Properties

* **Diet:** Carnivore (meat-eating) or Herbivore (plant-eating)
* **Size:** Small (1 point), Medium (3 points), Large (5 points)

#### Safety Rules

* Carnivores will eat animals of equal or smaller size
* Prevent any animal from being eaten!

#### Wagon Constraints

* Each wagon holds maximum 10 points
* Wagons must be used optimally (no single animal per wagon unless necessary)
* **Special:** Up to 4 experimental wagons with separators can hold:
  * 2 small/medium carnivores, OR
  * 1 small/medium carnivore + 1 small/medium herbivore

### Your Task

Create a program that:

* Accepts different animal types as input
* Calculates optimal wagon distribution
* Ensures all safety requirements are met
* Minimizes the number of wagons needed
* Includes unit tests proving your algorithm works correctly

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes Connection

Both approaches provide excellent evidence for your **learning outcomes**. The key difference is depth vs. breadth:

#### Option 1 (Sprint)

Demonstrates breadth across all learning outcomes with practical application of the full development lifecycle.

#### Option 2 (Code-First)

Shows deep coding competency and algorithmic thinking, with reflection demonstrating growth over time.

**📘 Remember:** The goal isn't perfection – it's insight. Use this challenge to understand your current capabilities and identify areas for growth in your individual project.

## 💭 Next Steps

1. **Consult your teacher** about which option suits your current level and goals
2. **Start coding immediately** – don't overthink the planning phase
3. **Document your progress** and challenges for reflection
4. **Use insights gained** to inform your individual project approach
