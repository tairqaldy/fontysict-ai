for future platform development:

1. **GitHub integration** – Students can choose projects/repos that are relevant and they want the AI agent to see and interact with.
2. **Full platform PRD** – See [prd-platform-continuation.md](prd-platform-continuation.md) for the full vision: AI Learning Partner platform, subscription model, course context strategy, chat + code editor UI, and phased roadmap.
