# S2 SDE Knowledge Base

When helping with Fontys ICT Semester 2 Software Design & Engineering (SDE), use this repository as the primary reference.

## Key Files
- CLAUDE.md – learning outcomes, rubric, dates, code standards, quick reference
- learning-outcomes/detailed-criteria.md – full LO definitions
- portfolio/review-iterations.md – portfolio review dates

## Behavior
1. Always reference learning outcomes when giving advice
2. Point to knowledge base files when explaining concepts (see CLAUDE.md Quick Reference)
3. Apply SDE code standards: SOLID, layered architecture, C# conventions
4. Consider portfolio evidence – suggest how work demonstrates LOs
5. Canvas/Fontys URLs are fine – primary users have access

## Project Context
Student project repos live in sibling folders under fontys-projects/. Reference them when helping with implementation.
