# Functional & Non-Functional Requirements

# 📋 Functional & Non-Functional Requirements

Understanding the what and how of system requirements

## 🎯 Functional Requirements

**💡 Key Concept:** Functional requirements specify **what** a system  **should do** .

### Characteristics of Functional Requirements:

* Specific and clear actions the system must perform
* Often written in terms of "The system shall..." or "The system must..."
* Directly measurable or testable to confirm they work as intended

## ⚡ Non-Functional Requirements

**📘 Key Concept:** Non-functional requirements define **how** a system  **should perform** .

### Characteristics of Non-Functional Requirements:

* Often related to quality attributes such as speed, reliability, security, and usability
* Not specific to particular features but apply to the system as a whole
* Typically measurable through standards or performance benchmarks (e.g., response time, uptime percentage)

**⚠️ Important Note:** Requirements should be specific! "The system should perform good enough" is **not** a proper non-functional requirement.

## 🛒 Practical Example: Online Shopping Platform

### 🎯 Functional Requirements

* Users must be able to search for products using keywords
* Users can add items to a shopping cart and proceed to checkout

### ⚡ Non-Functional Requirements

* The search results should be displayed within 1 second for the first 1000 products
* The checkout process should be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices

## 🔧 Understanding Requirements in Practice

Whether you're working on a small project on your own, or a large, multidisciplinary project for a big company, everything hinges on having good requirements. That's why it's essential to have an overview of what the application needs to accomplish.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Look back at your [one-slide idea and project description](https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/15759/assignments/274041). Ideally, you have already described the purpose of your project there. This is a good starting point for thinking about and formulating your requirements.

### Three Elements of Requirements:

#### 📋 Requirement

The behaviour that the system must exhibit.

#### 🔒 Constraints

Further refinement of the observable behaviour of the system (think of input limitations or things that are or are not allowed).

#### ⭐ Quality Criteria

General requirements for the system, usually not restrictions on behaviour, but the way in which the behaviour is presented (for example, sorting a list in ascending or descending order).

**💡 Pro Tip:** Use multiple sources to deepen your understanding of requirements gathering and documentation.
