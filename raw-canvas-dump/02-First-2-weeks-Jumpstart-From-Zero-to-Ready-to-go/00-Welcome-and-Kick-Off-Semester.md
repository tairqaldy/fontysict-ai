# Welcome and Kick-Off Semester

# Welcome to Software Design & Engineering!

The first day of the semester is all about introductions and an overview of what to expect in the coming weeks.

## Kick-Off by the Semester Coordinator

We will start with a  **Kick-Off session** , where the semester coordinator will explain the structure of this semester. You will get insights into:

* The setup of the semester and the projects
* What is expected from you as a student
* How to prepare yourself for a successful semester

## Getting to Know Your Semester Coach

After the Kick-Off, you will meet your **semester coach** and fellow students. This is an important moment to get to know your coach, ask questions, and understand how the guidance during the semester will work.
