# How to ensure the functional requirements are implemented as agreed?

# ✅ Validation & Acceptance Testing

Ensure your implementation matches stakeholder expectations

**⚠️ The Reality Check:** 70% of software projects fail not because of technical issues, but because they build the wrong thing. Acceptance testing is your safety net - it proves you built what was actually requested, not what you thought was requested.

**🎯 Workshop Goal:** Master User Acceptance Testing (UAT) - the bridge between requirements and reality. Learn to create test cases that validate your implementation against stakeholder expectations.

## 🔍 Why Acceptance Testing Matters

**🎯 Stakeholder Validation**

Proves your software meets the real business needs, not just technical specifications. It's the difference between "it works" and "it works for users."

**🛡️ Risk Mitigation**

Catch misunderstandings early. Better to discover problems during testing than after deployment when they're expensive to fix.

**📋 Documentation**

Creates a clear record of what was tested, what passed, and what failed. Essential for project accountability and future maintenance.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites & Setup

 **📋 Before You Start:** * Clear understanding of your target users and their needs

* Defined and validated [functional requirements and use cases](https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/15759/pages/how-can-functional-requirements-be-expressed-as-use-cases-and-a-conceptual-model)
* Basic knowledge of [test case structure](https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/15759/pages/acceptance-testing)
* Download and run either [StudyBuddy.zip](https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/15759/files/2576833?verifier=RjJ7dKeDE5lY7v9AvyZbloVrdLiGXXqZfiqJxjxz&wrap=1) or [TechnicalDocuments.zip](https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/15759/files/2576919?verifier=1ikPXoPDWtGdhjASJG7gA43kmAQSzuxnIy9oPmvw&wrap=1)

## 🎯 Testing Challenge

**📋 Choose Your Context**

You have two options for this workshop:

* **Option A:** Use your requirements from the [previous workshop](https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/15759/pages/how-can-functional-requirements-be-expressed-as-use-cases-and-a-conceptual-model)
* **Option B:** Use the provided [StudyBuddy requirements](https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/15759/files/2576829?verifier=sDpPSCqNg0XJyGk6wxdoJ3alvcRpibMwnS0lFOu5&wrap=1)

### Phase 1: Test Plan Creation

**🎯 Your Mission:** Create test cases that validate whether your implementation matches stakeholder expectations.* **Focus on user value:** What does success look like for the end user?

* **Cover edge cases:** What happens when things go wrong?
* **Test business rules:** Are constraints and validations working?
* **Verify quality criteria:** Does it meet non-functional requirements?

**📝 Effective Test Case Structure**

**Each test case should include:**

* **Test ID:** Unique identifier for tracking
* **Requirement Link:** Which requirement does this validate?
* **Preconditions:** What must be true before starting?
* **Test Steps:** Clear, actionable steps
* **Expected Result:** What should happen if it works correctly?
* **Actual Result:** What actually happened during testing?
* **Status:** Pass/Fail/Blocked

 **💡 Pro Testing Tips:** * **Test like a user:** Don't assume technical knowledge

* **Test the happy path:** Normal usage scenarios
* **Test the sad path:** Error conditions and edge cases
* **Test integrations:** How do different features work together?

### Phase 2: Test Execution & Reporting

 **🔄 Peer Testing Process:** 1. **Exchange test plans** with another team

1. **Execute tests** on StudyBuddy or TechnicalDocuments app
2. **Document results** objectively and thoroughly
3. **Provide recommendations** for improvement
4. **Report findings** using professional templates

**📊 Test Report Essentials**

**Your test report should include:**

* **Executive Summary:** High-level pass/fail status
* **Test Environment:** What was tested, when, by whom
* **Test Results:** Detailed findings for each test case
* **Defects Found:** Issues discovered during testing
* **Recommendations:** Next steps for improvement
* **Risk Assessment:** What's the impact of any failures?

## 🤝 Reflection & Learning

 **💭 Discussion Points:** * Which test cases were most effective at catching issues?

* What makes UAT different from technical testing?
* How can you improve test case clarity and effectiveness?
* What templates worked best for your team and why?
* How does testing change your perspective on requirements?

## 🎯 Learning Outcome Connection

**LO4: Managing - Testing & Quality Assurance**

Acceptance testing demonstrates your ability to manage quality throughout the development process:

* **Validation:** Ensure implementation matches requirements
* **Quality assurance:** Systematic approach to testing
* **Documentation:** Professional test planning and reporting
* **Risk management:** Identify and mitigate potential issues

## 🚀 Apply to Your Project

 **📈 Your Testing Journey:** 1. **Create acceptance criteria** for your individual project requirements

1. **Write test cases** that validate critical functionality
2. **Implement testing** as you build each feature
3. **Get peer validation** - have classmates test your implementation
4. **Document results** and iterate based on feedback

**🔄 Continuous Testing Mindset:** Don't wait until the end to test. Build testing into your development process from day one. Early testing leads to better software and fewer late-night debugging sessions.

*🎯 Testing Truth: The goal isn't to prove your software works perfectly. The goal is to discover where it doesn't work, so you can fix it before your users*
