# Creating Functional & Non-Functional Requirements

# 📋 Creating Functional & Non-Functional Requirements

Master the art of capturing what systems should do and how they should perform

**🎯 Workshop Objective:** Learn to distinguish between functional and non-functional requirements and create clear, testable specifications that guide development and validation.

## 🔍 Understanding Requirements

**Functional Requirements: The "What"**

Define specific actions and behaviors the system must perform.

* Describe specific features and functionalities
* Written as "The system shall..." statements
* Directly testable and measurable
* Focus on business logic and user interactions

**Non-Functional Requirements: The "How"**

Define quality attributes and constraints on system behavior.

* Performance, security, usability, reliability
* Apply to the system as a whole
* Measurable through standards and benchmarks
* Often define acceptance criteria

## 🛒 Real-World Example: E-commerce Platform

 **📝 Functional Requirements:** * Users must be able to search for products using keywords

* Users can add items to a shopping cart and proceed to checkout
* System shall process payments securely
* Users can view order history and track shipments

 **⚡ Non-Functional Requirements:** * Search results display within 1 second for first 1000 products

* System supports 10,000 concurrent users
* 99.9% uptime availability
* Mobile-responsive design for all devices

## 🏋️ Workshop Challenge

**🎯 Your Mission:** Create a comprehensive User Requirements Specification (URS) for any of the case studies below. Choose your approach:* **Solo:** Work through all cases independently

* **Collaborative:** Discuss cases with peers for shared understanding
* **Pair Work:** Split features between pairs, then combine results
* **Review:** Present your work to teachers for feedback

### Case Study 1: Bank Account System

Account holders have payment accounts. It is possible to transfer an amount from one account to another. It is also possible to add new accounts to the system and to cancel accounts. These last two tasks cannot be performed by the user himself.

**💡 Consider:** Security, transaction limits, audit trails, user authentication, system availability requirements.

### Case Study 2: Library Management System

At the library you can borrow books at the lending desk if you are a member. You need a card that you can request directly at the registration desk and you may have borrowed a maximum of 5 books at any time. If there is an outstanding fine of more than 10 euros, the fine must first be paid off before a book can be borrowed.

Returned books are deposited in a special letterbox and end up in the return area. Here, temporary workers check the books for damage and register that the books have been returned. The books are then placed back in the correct place in the library.

**💡 Consider:** Member management, book tracking, fine calculations, damage assessment procedures, staff workflow efficiency.

### Case Study 3: Cinema Booking System

At the "Kipsaté" cinema you can buy or reserve tickets for films at the counter. Behind the counter are two cash registers (computers) which are manned alternately by Pauline, Astrid, Joep and Willem. When buying or reserving tickets, you can indicate which seats you want (you can see which seats are still available and which are already occupied). If you have reserved tickets but do not collect and pay for them at least 20 minutes before the start of the film, your reservation will expire and the reserved tickets can be sold to other cinema visitors.

The intention is that in the new situation (when the software is ready) it should be possible to buy and reserve tickets via the internet, and that self-service devices will be placed next to the counter with which a visitor can buy a ticket for one of the films that starts within an hour in case the queue at the counter becomes too long. Reservations cannot be made on these devices because that takes too much time. You will always receive one confirmation of your purchases or reservations: via the internet by e-mail, via the counter or a printed receipt at a self-service device.

**💡 Consider:** Multi-channel booking, seat management, payment processing, automated reservations cleanup, staff workflow, customer notifications.
