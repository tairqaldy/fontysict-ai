Evidence-based problem solving using the DOT framework

**🎯 Learning Connection:** Research skills are fundamental to **Learning Outcome 5: Professional Standard** - using reliable sources to support your decisions and validate information using standard methods.

## 🤔 What is ICT Research?

**Core Definition**

ICT research is a systematic investigation to solve complex technical problems. It involves gathering evidence, evaluating solutions, and making informed decisions that align the best technological approaches with specific business contexts and user needs.

## 🎯 Why Research is Critical in ICT

#### 🧠 Informed Decision Making

Research provides the evidence base needed to make well-informed decisions and elevate your project beyond guesswork to professional-level solutions.

#### 💡 Innovation & Problem-Solving

Research is integral to innovation and problem-solving, helping you discover new approaches and validate creative solutions.

#### 🎯 Context-Specific Solutions

The ICT world offers numerous solutions, but each business context is unique. Research enables you to align the best solution with the specific desired situation.

#### 📈 Professional Development

Research skills are critical for ICT professionals, enabling evidence-based technical decision making throughout your career.

## 🔬 The DOT Framework Introduction

**DOT Research Framework**

The DOT framework is your guide for systematic ICT research, helping you choose appropriate methods and validate your findings professionally.

**📚 Essential Resource:** Explore the complete DOT framework and ICT research methods at [ICT Research Methods**Links to an external site.**](https://ictresearchmethods.nl/)

In this workshop, you'll gain awareness of research opportunities and learn to identify knowledge gaps that require systematic investigation.

## 🎯 Identifying Research Opportunities

Your primary goal is developing research awareness - identifying areas in your projects where systematic investigation will improve outcomes:

**🔍 Problem Understanding Research**

**When to research:** If you don't fully understand the root of the problem

**Research focus:** Stakeholder interviews, problem analysis, current state assessment

**📋 Requirements Research**

**When to research:** If you're unclear about required functionalities of the end product

**Research focus:** User needs analysis, functional requirements gathering, acceptance criteria definition

**🛠️ Implementation Research**

**When to research:** If you're unsure how to create the product

**Research focus:** Technology comparison, architectural patterns, implementation strategies

**✅ Validation Research**

**When to research:** If you need to validate your solution approach

**Research focus:** Usability testing, performance validation, stakeholder feedback collection

## 🛠️ Research Method Selection

**Strategic Method Selection**

When choosing research methods, consider both effort and outcome:

#### ⚖️ Effort Assessment

* Time investment required
* Complexity of implementation
* Resource availability
* Skill requirements

#### 🎯 Value Evaluation

* Quality of insights gained
* Relevance to your goals
* Actionability of results
* Impact on project success

#### 👨‍🏫 Teacher Consultation

Discuss method selection with your technical teacher to ensure alignment with research goals and project constraints.

## 📋 Portfolio Assignment: Research Documentation

**Assignment: Research Planning & Rationale**

Document your research approach in your portfolio, focusing on **why** you're conducting research:

#### 📝 Required Documentation Structure:

##### 1️⃣ Problem Context

Describe the problem your overall project aims to solve and why it constitutes a genuine problem worth addressing.

##### 2️⃣ Desired Outcome

Describe the desired end state of your project. What specific product or solution will you deliver?

##### 3️⃣ Implementation Strategy

Explain your planned approach for creating the solution, including key technical and process decisions.

##### 4️⃣ Knowledge Gaps

Identify specific points where you expect to need research. Where do you currently lack knowledge or skills?

##### 5️⃣ Research Methodology

Describe your planned research methods using the DOT framework. How will you systematically investigate these knowledge gaps?

**💡 Pro Tip:** Focus on the 'why' behind your research. Strong rationale demonstrates professional thinking and helps readers understand your decision-making process.

## 🚀 Next Steps

**🔄 Research Reflection & Analysis**
