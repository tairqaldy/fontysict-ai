## 🛠️ 6-Step Client Interaction Process

Master client interaction through structured preparation and continuous improvement:

**Step 1: Define Presentation Purpose**

What purpose does your presentation serve? Clarify your core objectives:

* **Persuading:** Gaining approval for design choices or resource requests
* **Problem-solving:** Discussing challenges and seeking stakeholder input
* **Demonstrating:** Showcasing features, prototypes, or completed work

**Step 2: Analyze Your Target Audience**

Who is your target audience? Tailor your approach based on stakeholder characteristics:

Are they technical experts or business stakeholders? Adjust complexity accordingly.

#### ⏰ Time Constraints

How much time do they have? Prioritize most important information first.

#### 🎪 Decision Authority

Can they make decisions or do they need to report to others? Frame accordingly.

**Step 3: Create Clear Structure**

Build a logical, easy-to-follow presentation structure:

Present key information, demonstrate work, discuss challenges and solutions

##### 🎯 Conclusion (10-15%)

Summarize key points, outline next steps, invite questions and feedback
