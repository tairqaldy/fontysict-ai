# Reviewing Research using DOT framework

# 🔄 Research Review & Analysis

Reflecting on your research journey using the DOT framework

**🎯 Learning Connection:** Research reflection enhances **Learning Outcome 5: Professional Standard** by demonstrating how you validate sources, apply standard research methods, and make evidence-based decisions in your projects.

## 🤔 What is Research Review & Analysis?

**Core Concept**

Research review involves systematically reflecting on the research you've conducted, mapping your activities to the DOT framework domains, and articulating how your research methods contributed to project outcomes. This process transforms unconscious research activities into documented, professional methodology.

## 🎯 Why Research Review is Essential

#### 🧠 Conscious Competence

Many students conduct research without conscious awareness. Review helps you identify and articulate the research methods you actually used.

#### 📂 Portfolio Strengthening

Explicit documentation of research methods and their contributions significantly strengthens your portfolio evidence and assessment outcomes.

#### 🎯 Deliberate Future Choices

Understanding your research patterns enables more deliberate, strategic method selection in future projects.

#### 🔍 Gap Identification

Systematic review reveals research gaps and opportunities for additional investigation to strengthen your project.

## 🛠️ 5-Step Research Review Process

**Step 1: Activity Inventory**

Create a comprehensive overview of all project activities you've completed:

#### 📋 Project Activities

* Stakeholder interviews
* Technology investigations
* Design decisions
* Testing activities

#### 🔍 Information Gathering

* Literature reviews
* Market research
* Competitor analysis
* User feedback collection

#### 🧪 Validation Activities

* Prototype testing
* Usability studies
* Performance benchmarks
* Stakeholder validation

**Step 2: DOT Framework Mapping**

Analyze which of your activities align with specific DOT framework domains and methods:

**📚 DOT Framework Reference:** Use the comprehensive [ICT Research Methods**Links to an external site.**](https://ictresearchmethods.nl/) resource to identify specific methods you applied.

##### 🎯 Research Questions

Which research questions did you formulate? How did they guide your investigation approach?

##### 🔬 Research Methods

Which specific DOT framework methods did you use? Surveys, experiments, case studies, literature reviews?

##### 📊 Data Collection

How did you gather evidence? What data sources did you use and why?

##### 🔍 Analysis Techniques

How did you analyze and interpret your findings? What frameworks guided your analysis?

**Step 3: Reflective Analysis**

Write a structured reflection that clarifies your research process and its impact:

#### 📝 Reflection Framework:

##### 🎯 Research Purpose

Why did you need this research? What decisions depended on these findings?

##### ⚙️ Method Selection

Why did you choose these specific research methods? What alternatives did you consider?

##### 📈 Impact Assessment

How did your research findings influence project decisions and outcomes?

##### 🎓 Learning Insights

What did you learn about research methodology? What would you do differently next time?

**Step 4: Gap Analysis & Future Planning**

Identify areas where additional research could strengthen your project:

#### 🔍 Research Gaps

* Unanswered questions
* Insufficient evidence
* Stakeholder blind spots
* Technical uncertainties

#### 📋 Research Planning

* Priority additional research
* Method selection rationale
* Timeline and resources
* Expected outcomes

#### 🎯 Strategic Focus

* Highest-impact investigations
* Risk mitigation research
* Validation opportunities
* Innovation exploration

**Step 5: Portfolio Integration**

Integrate your research analysis into your portfolio with explicit DOT framework methodology references:

 **📂 Portfolio Documentation Requirements:** * **Research overview:** Summary of all research activities mapped to DOT framework

* **Method justification:** Rationale for specific method selection
* **Impact demonstration:** How research findings influenced project decisions
* **Professional reflection:** Learning outcomes and future improvement strategies

**💡 Pro Tip:** Research review isn't about proving you did everything perfectly - it's about demonstrating conscious, methodical thinking and continuous improvement in your professional approach.

## 🚀 Next Steps

**✍️ Professional Documentation**

Apply your research insights by creating professional documentation with structured writing support and feedback.
