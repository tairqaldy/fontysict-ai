## ![1770711501615](image/01-Feedback/1770711501615.png)🤔 What is Feedback?

**Academic Definition**

"Feedback is information provided by an agent (e.g., teacher, peer, book, parent, experience) regarding aspects of one's performance or understanding. It occurs typically after instruction that seeks to provide knowledge and skills or to develop particular attitudes."

*— Hattie, 2007*

## 🎯 Why Feedback Matters

#### 🎓 Educational Foundation

Feedback is the cornerstone of our learning and assessment process at Fontys ICT.

#### 🪞 Self-Awareness

Feedback helps you become more self-aware of your own behavior and performance patterns.

#### 🧭 Direction & Focus

Feedback provides the information you need to keep moving in the right direction.

## 🛠️ The 4-Step Feedback Process

**Step 1: Giving Effective Feedback**

 **📺 Watch:** [TED Talk - The Secret to Giving Great Feedback**Links to an external site.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtl5UrrgU8c)[![](https://fhict.instructure.com/images/play_overlay.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtl5UrrgU8c)

1. **Micro-yes:** Pace the other person for the feedback you're about to give them
2. **Be specific:** Avoid blur words - give specific feedback about what needs to increase or diminish
3. **Show impact:** Demonstrate the impact of the person's actions
4. **Ask for input:** Request suggestions from the other person to solve the problem

**Step 2: Asking for Feedback**

**📖 Resource:** [Fontys Feedback Guide for Students**Links to an external site.**](https://www.fontys.nl/Content/Feedback-Guide_STUDENT.htm)

#### Transform These Questions:

**❌ Instead of:** "I'm stuck, what should I do?"

**✅ Ask:** "What problem am I facing? Which solutions do I see and have tried? What are the consequences? Which solution would I choose without assistance? What would be your advice?"

**❌ Instead of:** "Is this good enough?"

**✅ Ask:** "How much time and energy have I invested? Is this my best version for now? Which part needs feedback? How does my performance match the learning outcome? What's your opinion?"

**❌ Instead of:** "What do I need to improve?"

**✅ Ask:** "How far have I progressed? Do I think it meets expected quality? What's my blind spot and where can I improve?"

**Step 3: Receiving Feedback**

1. **Practice active listening:** Summarize or paraphrase their points to confirm understanding
2. **Avoid defensiveness:** Stay calm and composed during the conversation
3. **Ask clarifying questions:** Ensure you understand the feedback clearly
4. **Request specifics:** If feedback is vague, ask for concrete examples or improvement suggestions
5. **Separate message from messenger:** Focus on the content, not who's delivering it
6. **Take time to reflect:** Process what you've heard before responding or taking action
7. **Follow up:** Check back after reflection and/or implementing changes

**Step 4: Practice Peer Feedback**

After every iteration, practice giving peer feedback within your project group. This should be twofold:

#### 🔧 Technical Feedback

On deliverables, code quality, and technical solutions

#### 👥 Process Feedback

On behavior, collaboration, and working methods

**🛠️ Tools:** Practice peer feedback via **Feedpulse** and perform group retrospectives.
