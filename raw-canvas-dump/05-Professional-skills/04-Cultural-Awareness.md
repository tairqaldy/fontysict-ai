**Core Definition**

Cultural awareness involves **understanding and appreciating** the diverse cultural backgrounds and perspectives of your peers. It means recognizing the differences and similarities between cultures and **being aware** of how cultural influences shape individuals' behaviors, values, and communication styles.

## 🎯 Why Cultural Awareness Matters

#### 🎓 International Education

You're enrolled in an international program where you meet people with different backgrounds, cultures, and habits.

#### 💼 Global Career Reality

IT is an international field. You'll likely work in global companies or with international partners.

#### 🗣️ Enhanced Communication

Understanding cultural differences dramatically improves your communication effectiveness.

## 🛠️ 4-Step Development Process

**Step 1: Participate in Cultural Activities**

Engage actively in cultural awareness workshops and activities offered throughout your program. These structured experiences provide foundational knowledge and safe spaces to explore cultural differences.

**Step 2: Interact with Diverse Peers**

#### 🤝 Diverse Project Groups

Intentionally form project groups with students from different cultural backgrounds to learn from each other's perspectives.

#### 👫 Build Friendships

Make an effort to form genuine friendships with students from diverse backgrounds beyond just academic collaboration.

**Step 3: Practice Cross-Cultural Communication**

Apply these evidence-based communication strategies in your group projects:

##### 🪞 Acknowledge Your Biases

Research shows that simply being reminded we have biases helps us make more bias-free decisions.

##### 🤸 Practice Flexibility

The more communication approaches you master, the more effective you'll be in international environments.

##### ⏸️ Slow Down & Check Assumptions

Quick reactions based on inaccurate assumptions reduce cross-cultural effectiveness.

##### 💚 Assume Positive Intentions

This mindset enables productive conversations to understand each other's behaviors.

##### 📢 Share Impact & State Intent

Use Describe, Interpret, Evaluate (D.I.E.) when behaviors confuse you. Clearly state your intentions to avoid misunderstandings.

##### 👂 Listen Openly & Empathically

Active, empathetic listening is the foundation of effective cross-cultural communication.
