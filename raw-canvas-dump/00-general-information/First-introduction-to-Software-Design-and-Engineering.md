# First introduction to Software Design & Engineering

# Welcome to Software Design & Engineering

Your journey into professional software development starts here

## 🗓️ Your First Two Weeks

This first two weeks, you will get a kick start into Software Design & Engineering. How the semester is structured and what it entails. Through workshops, self-study on Canvas, and hands-on exercises (both individually and in groups), and starting development on the circus train assignment, you will explore the semester's core elements. By the end of these weeks, you should have a clear understanding of what is expected and how to plan your approach.

**💡 Getting Organized:** On Canvas, you'll find various exercises and assignments to complete independently. Together with your instructor, you'll start crafting a project plan for your Individual Project (IP) and form groups for the Group Project (GP, also known as the 'Proftaak').

## 🎯 What You'll Be Working On

This semester revolves around two major projects that will challenge you to apply software engineering principles in different contexts:

**🧑‍💻 Individual Project (IP)**

You take the role of both developer *and* client. Choose your own topic from your interests or hobbies, identify problems that software can solve, and build a complete application from start to finish.

**Key Focus:** Personal ownership, technical implementation, and demonstrating all learning outcomes through your individual work.

**👥 Group Project (GP) - "Proftaak"**

Work in teams of 6-7 students with real Partners in Education (PIE) companies. You'll manage client communication, deliver iterative updates, and create software that solves actual business problems.

**Key Focus:** Teamwork, professional client management, agile development practices, and delivering real value to external stakeholders.
