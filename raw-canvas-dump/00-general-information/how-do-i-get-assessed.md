# ✅ How Do I Get Assessed?

Show your learning journey and receive valuable feedback

**📈 Assessment Philosophy:** In this semester, assessment moments help you show how your work aligns with the learning outcomes and allow you to receive feedback to improve. This gives you a better understanding of what is expected and how you can enhance your work.

## 📊 Three Types of Assessment

1

### 🔄 Feedpulse

Continuous feedback on individual work

✓Feedback on individual parts of your work, such as specific assignments or artifacts

✓You receive oral feedback and record it in Feedpulse to continue improving

**Frequency:** Ongoing throughout the semester

2

### 📂 Portfolio Reviews

Iterative assessment of your learning journey

✓At the end of each iteration (approximately four weeks), you submit a portfolio snapshot (also see [Planning of Software Design &amp; Engineering](https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/15759/pages/planning-of-software-design-and-engineering "Planning of Software Design &amp; Engineering"))

✓Portfolio contains evidence and reflections showing alignment with learning outcomes

✓You discuss your portfolio with your group and teachers

✓After the review your teachers will update the rubrics

**💡 Assessment Guarantee:** If you achieve at least 'Proficient' on all learning outcomes at the end of the semester, you're guaranteed a 'Satisfactory' grade or better. This allows you to focus on key improvement areas without worrying about meeting minimum requirements.

**Frequency:** About every 4 weeks (end of each iteration)
