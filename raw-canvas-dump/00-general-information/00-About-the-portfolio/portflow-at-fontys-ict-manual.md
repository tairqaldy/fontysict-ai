### Collections

Structure your portfolio by creating collections within a section. Within a collection, you can place products and gather feedback in the context of your completed projects. This approach aligns with [the educational vision**Links to an external site.**](https://beleidswiki.fhict.nl/doku.php?id=beleid:onderwijsvisie&s[]=%2Avisie%2A) of Fontys ICT and its associated [assessment policy**Links to an external site.**](https://beleidswiki.fhict.nl/doku.php?id=beleid:toetsbeleid&s[]=%2Atoetsbeleid%2A).

 **📋 To Do:** * Create a collection for each project: **Your (Group) Project - `<Project Name>`**
