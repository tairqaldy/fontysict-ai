# Individual Project

# 👤 Individual Project

You are the client - Define your own software solution

**📝 Project Overview:** While the Group Project involves working with a real client who defines what you will create, the Individual Project puts you in the client's seat. You are responsible for selecting your topic and determining what is important. Here's a general roadmap for how your Individual Project will progress this semester.

## 🚀 Project Roadmap

### 1Choose a Topic for Your Application

Start by picking a subject you know something about—it could be a hobby, interest, or activity, such as a sport you play or an instrument you enjoy.

**💡 Think Like a Software Engineer:** In the real world, software applications are usually solutions to problems. Clients come to you with issues, and your job is to understand their problem, design a solution, and implement it. When choosing a topic, consider what kind of "problem" you could solve with software.

### 2Identify a Problem Software Can Solve

Think about challenges within your chosen domain where software could provide a solution. For instance:

**🏀 Team Sports:** Build an application to manage schedules and teams

**🎨 Art & Creativity:** Create an online gallery for your artwork

**🎵 Music & Collections:** Develop a tool to manage your vinyl record collection

You could also make an app for chatting with friends or organizing your favorite games. Let your creativity guide you!

### 3Determine the Complexity

Your project needs to meet a certain level of complexity to demonstrate the required learning outcomes:

* **Requirements:** Define multiple requirements for your application
* **Database:** Store and manage data using a database
* **Entities:** Incorporate multiple entities (e.g., users, items, events)

**⚠️ Important:** You don't need to plan everything from the start. Working iteratively means your application will grow with each delivery, and new insights may lead to additional features.

Make sure your application aligns with the learning outcomes, as your assessment depends on it. Review these outcomes regularly, reflect on your progress, and create a solid project plan.

### 4How to Get Started

In the first iteration, you'll make a strong start by working on all the professional products needed for your project. By the end of the first week, you should have a well-defined idea and have received feedback from peers and instructors. Use this feedback to refine your concept.

#### (Possible) First Iteration Deliverables:

✓Initial requirements for your application

✓A first minimal working version of your application

### 📚 Resources & Support

The [**Resources**](https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/15759/modules/124191) module provides techniques aligned with the learning outcomes. While there's some flexibility for personal choices, these must be discussed with your instructors and justified with a solid rationale.

**Remember:** To ensure you're on the right track, discuss your products, plans, and processes with your instructors weekly.
