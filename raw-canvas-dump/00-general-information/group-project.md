# Group Project

# 👥 Group Project

Collaborate with real clients on professional software projects

**🏢 Professional Experience:** In addition to your Individual Project, you will collaborate with fellow students on a Group Project this semester. This project will be an assignment provided by a Partner in Education (PIE), and your group will be responsible for professionally managing the project.

This software project will require your team to create a detailed plan, ensure effective internal and client communication, and design and develop the application. At the end of each iteration, your team will present your progress to the client during a demo session.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📅Week 1: Team Formation

You will form groups of 6–7 students, depending on class size. This process will be guided by your instructors, who will help facilitate team formation.

 **Focus Areas:** * Get to know each other

* Establish team agreements
* Create initial planning

### 🏢Week 2: Project Matching

PIE companies will present their assignments, and groups will be matched with a project. From then on, your professionalism and independence will be key in delivering value to the client.

 **What to Expect:** * Company presentations

* Project assignment
* Client introduction

## 🔄 Iterative Work Process

**📈 Iterative Development:** Like the Individual Project, the Group Project will follow an iterative development approach. Every three weeks, your team will deliver an iteration to the client.

**⚠️ Client Expectations:** The client expects to see a usable and valuable product as early as possible. This means your deliverables should not be limited to backend components like databases but should represent a functional and visually clear aspect of the final product.

These early deliverables provide the client with insights into the project's direction, enabling them to give feedback, adjust requirements, or introduce new ideas.

### Essential Sessions Per Iteration

1

#### Planning Session

At the start of each iteration, plan tasks with your team and the client to ensure a clear direction.

2

#### Demo Session

Present your progress and deliverables to the client in a professional demo session.

3

#### Retrospective

At the end of each iteration, review what went well and what could improve. Define actionable steps for the next iteration.

4

#### Self-Reflection

Reflect on your individual contributions and results, documenting them in your portfolio as evidence of your progress.

### 🎓 Support & Guidance

Your Semester Coach and instructors will support you throughout the project to ensure the process remains professional, productive, and aligned with learning goals.
