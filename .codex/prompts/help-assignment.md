# Assignment Help

I need help understanding and approaching an assignment for my Fontys ICT S2 SDE course.

## Context

Read the course context from CLAUDE.md in this repository root.

Also check these knowledge base files:
- course-info/assessment.md
- learning-outcomes/overview.md
- learning-outcomes/detailed-criteria.md
- course-info/individual-project.md
- course-info/group-project.md
- course-info/extra-project.md
- portfolio/review-iterations.md (for iteration dates)

## Task

The student will describe an assignment or paste its description. You should:

1. **Summarize** what the assignment asks for in plain language
2. **Identify which learning outcomes** this assignment addresses
3. **Break it down** into concrete, actionable steps
4. **Flag any requirements** the student might overlook
5. **Suggest which project repo** this work belongs in (check sibling folders under fontys-projects/)
6. **Recommend** what portfolio evidence this assignment can produce

Be practical and actionable. This is an HBO (applied sciences) program - focus on building working software, not academic theory. Use C# / ASP.NET examples where relevant.
