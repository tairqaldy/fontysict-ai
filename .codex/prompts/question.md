# Ask a Question (Project, Program, Schedule, etc.)

## Context

Read the course context from **CLAUDE.md** in this repository root. Use it as the master navigation map.

This repository is the S2 SDE knowledge base. Search across all relevant directories to find the best answer:
- **course-info/** – projects, assessment, schedule
- **learning-outcomes/** – LOs, criteria
- **portfolio/** – portfolio guide, iterations, dates
- **skills/** – professional and software-development guides
- **resources/** – theory and reference
- **jumpstart/** – first weeks material
- **extra/** – supplementary material

Use **CLAUDE.md Quick Reference** (table) to route questions to the right files quickly.

## Task

The user has a question about their project, program, schedule, assignment, or anything S2 SDE-related. Provide:

### 1. Concise direct answer
- Answer the question clearly and briefly
- Use simple language; avoid jargon unless necessary
- Relate to the user's context (S2 SDE student, HBO, Fontys ICT)

### 2. References to detailed sources
- Point to specific knowledge base files: `path/to/file.md`
- Include links to Canvas/Fontys pages when relevant
- Suggest "Read more: [file](path)" with a short note on what they'll find

### 3. Additional resources
- List 1–3 extra resources (other KB files, workshop links, documentation) if useful
- Keep it actionable rather than overwhelming

### 4. Terminology check
- If your answer uses any technical terms (e.g. SOLID, DTO, layered architecture, iteration), add:
  - **"Want me to explain …?"** – offer to clarify any term in simpler words
  - Use analogies and relatable examples when explaining

### 5. Follow-up
- End with: "Anything else you'd like clarified or explored?" so the user can ask for more detail

## Behavior

- **Navigate first** – search the knowledge base before answering; don't guess
- **Be concise** – lead with the answer, then references
- **Be helpful** – if the KB doesn't fully cover it, say so and suggest where to look (Canvas, teacher, etc.)
- **Respect context** – Fontys ICT S2, HBO, C#/ASP.NET, portfolio-based assessment
