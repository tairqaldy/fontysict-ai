## How to Use This Template

A structured **Research Document Template (PDF)** is provided in the course materials to help you document your ICT research in a professional way (problem context, questions, methods, results, conclusions).

- Original file: `raw-canvas-dump/05-Professional-skills/Research Document Template_final.pdf`
- Recommended use: download the PDF, fill it in for your own research, and reference the resulting document in your portfolio as evidence for Learning Outcome 5.

This markdown file intentionally does **not** duplicate the template; it serves as a pointer so agents and students know where to find and how to use the official document template.
