# Client interaction - video feedback

# 📹 Video Feedback Analysis

Developing self-awareness through objective presentation analysis

**🎯 Learning Connection:** Video feedback develops both **Learning Outcome 5: Professional Standard** (communication skills) and **Learning Outcome 6: Personal Leadership** (self-reflection and feedback utilization).

## 🤔 What is Video Feedback Analysis?

Video feedback analysis involves systematically reviewing recordings of your presentations to develop objective self-awareness about your communication effectiveness. This method allows you to shift perspective and evaluate your presentation skills through the lens of your audience.

## 🛠️ 4-Step Video Analysis Process

1. **Record Your Presentation** – capture audio, visuals, and slides clearly.  
2. **Initial Viewing (No Criticism)** – watch once without judging, to get used to seeing yourself.  
3. **Structured Analysis & Feedback** – review structure, audience engagement, non-verbal and verbal communication, and supporting materials.  
4. **Collaborative Teacher Review** – share your self-evaluation, gather teacher insights, and create an action plan.

## 📈 Long-term Development Strategy

- Record presentations regularly.  
- Compare recordings to track progress.  
- Document your analysis and improvements in your portfolio as evidence for LO5 and LO6.
