# 🔄 Research Review & Analysis

Reflecting on your research journey using the DOT framework

**🎯 Learning Connection:** Research reflection enhances **Learning Outcome 5: Professional Standard** by demonstrating how you validate sources, apply standard research methods, and make evidence-based decisions in your projects.

## 🤔 What is Research Review & Analysis?

Research review involves systematically reflecting on the research you've conducted, mapping your activities to the DOT framework domains, and articulating how your research methods contributed to project outcomes.

## 🛠️ 5-Step Research Review Process

1. **Activity Inventory** – list your project and research activities.  
2. **DOT Framework Mapping** – connect activities to DOT methods (see `https://ictresearchmethods.nl/`).  
3. **Reflective Analysis** – describe purpose, method selection, impact, and learning.  
4. **Gap Analysis & Future Planning** – identify where further research would help.  
5. **Portfolio Integration** – document research overview, methods, impact, and reflection.
