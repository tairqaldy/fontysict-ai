# User Interface and Wireframe Design

# 🎨 UI & Wireframe Design

Bridge the gap between ideas and implementation through visual design

**⚠️ Problem:** Poor UX design leads to building what teams *think* users want, not what they actually need. Wireframes help you validate concepts early.

**🎯 Workshop Goal:** Learn to create wireframes that communicate user flows, validate concepts with stakeholders, and guide development teams.

## 🔍 Why Wireframes Matter

- Early problem detection  
- Stakeholder alignment  
- Faster development and fewer misunderstandings
