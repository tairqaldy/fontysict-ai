**🎯 Workshop Goal:** Understand both anemic and rich domain models, their trade-offs, and when to use each.

## Anemic Domain Model

- Data containers with getters/setters  
- Business logic in services  
- Simpler to understand, closer to procedural code  

## Rich Domain Model

- Encapsulates both data and behavior  
- Business logic lives inside domain objects  
- Better for complex domains and DDD-style designs
