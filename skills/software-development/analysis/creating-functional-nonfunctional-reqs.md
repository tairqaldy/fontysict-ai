# 📋 Creating Functional & Non-Functional Requirements

Master the art of capturing what systems should do and how they should perform

**🎯 Workshop Objective:** Learn to distinguish between functional and non-functional requirements and create clear, testable specifications that guide development and validation.

## 🔍 Understanding Requirements

### Functional Requirements: The "What"

Define specific actions and behaviors the system must perform.

* Describe specific features and functionalities  
* Written as "The system shall..." statements  
* Directly testable and measurable  
* Focus on business logic and user interactions  

### Non-Functional Requirements: The "How"

Define quality attributes and constraints on system behavior.

* Performance, security, usability, reliability  
* Apply to the system as a whole  
* Measurable through standards and benchmarks  
* Often define acceptance criteria  

## 🛒 Real-World Example: E-commerce Platform

**Functional Requirements**

* Users can add items to a shopping cart and proceed to checkout  
* System shall process payments securely  
* Users can view order history and track shipments  

**Non-Functional Requirements**

* Search results display within 1 second for first 1000 products  
* System supports 10,000 concurrent users  
* 99.9% uptime availability  
* Mobile-responsive design for all devices
