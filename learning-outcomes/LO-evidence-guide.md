## The 6 Learning Outcomes

| LO          | Name                  | Core meaning                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | Analysis              | Gather and document validated user specifications based on stakeholder feedback, using a standard method for simple, non-distributed applications.                 |
| **2** | Design                | Methodically translate validated specifications into software and database designs (maintainable + secure). Justify your choices.                                  |
| **3** | Implementation        | Build and deliver multiple secure, maintainable applications (at least one web-based) iteratively. Apply OOP and SOLID. Use a relational database for persistence. |
| **4** | Managing              | Use version control, (automated) testing, and an iterative process to improve code quality. Explain how chosen techniques contribute.                              |
| **5** | Professional Standard | Apply professional practice in project organisation, communication with stakeholders, exploratory research, and reporting.                                         |
| **6** | Personal Leadership   | Take initiative in asking for and reflecting on feedback. Identify core values as basis for study career and professional development.                             |

## Evidence Types per LO

| LO                              | Evidence types                                                         | Examples                                                                                                    |

| **1 Analysis**            | Requirements docs, use cases, acceptance tests, stakeholder validation | Analysis document, use cases, conceptual model, validated acceptance criteria                               |
| **2 Design**              | Architecture, domain, and DB designs                                   | Architecture diagrams, class diagrams, ER diagrams, design rationale/justification                          |

## Self-Assessment per Learning Outcome

> **Workshop note:** You need to write a **Self Assessment for each learning outcome** that contains reflection on how you contributed to that LO.

For each LO in your portfolio:

- Describe how *your* work contributed to that outcome
- Reflect on what you did, what you learned, and where you grew
- Connect specific evidence pieces to the outcome

## Links & Artifacts to Include

| Item                              | Why                                                           | Relevant LO    |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Git repo (working link)** | Shows version control, iteration, commit history              | 4 Managing     |
| **Trello/Jira board link**  | Shows project organisation, backlog, transparency             | 5 Professional |
| **Shared backlog**          | Demonstrates professional practice and stakeholder visibility | 5 Professional |
| **Research document**       | Exploratory research using DOT framework                      | 5 Professional |

## Evidence Formats (Portfolio)

| Format                | Use for                                  | Examples                                                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Documents**   | PDFs preferred                           | Analyses, designs, evaluations, reflections                   |
| **Source code** | Describe highlights, include screenshots | Git repo link + access for coaches; or ZIP (exclude binaries) |
| **Diagrams**    | Add descriptions                         | UML, workflows, architecture, ER diagrams                     |

**Evidence description** (required per piece): What it is, who it's for, why it demonstrates the LO.

## Workshop Highlights

- **Shared inspo** on what good Portflow looks like – use examples from teachers/peers
- Self-assessment is not just listing work – it's reflection on your contribution
- Professional Standard (LO 5): backlog visibility and board links matter
