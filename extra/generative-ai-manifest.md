# Generative AI & The Fontys ICT AI Manifest

Your guide to responsible AI use in software development education

Generative AI is transforming software development. As a future software engineer, you need to understand how to use these powerful tools responsibly and effectively in your learning and professional practice.

**Important:** This page outlines our institutional approach to AI. Understanding and following these guidelines is essential for your success in this course and your professional development.

## The Fontys ICT AI Manifest

These guidelines provide both students and educators with a common foundation for the responsible use of generative AI in education. This manifesto emphasizes ethical principles, transparency, and accountability in integrating AI technologies into the learning process.

**⚠️ Please Note:** This policy framework is actively being refined based on ongoing experience and feedback.

### The Seven Principles

#### 🚀 1. Use: Responsible Encouragement

AI is used responsibly for all purposes and this is encouraged in education.

We encourage you to explore and use AI tools as part of your learning toolkit. Don't hesitate to leverage AI for coding assistance, analysis, research, and problem-solving. This is not cheating - it's developing professional skills.

#### 📋 2. Accountability: Transparent Communication

The responsible use of AI requires clear communication about resources and processes to ensure the integrity of learning.

Always document when and how you used AI in your work. In your portfolio and project documentation, be explicit about your AI usage. Transparency builds trust and demonstrates professional integrity.

#### ✅ 3. Validation: Critical Review

Students review and validate the results of AI.

AI can and will make mistakes. You are responsible for reviewing, testing, and validating all AI-generated content. Always understand what AI produces before using it in your work.

#### 🔄 4. Process: Learning-Focused

Students use AI as input for their learning. The focus is not on the product, but on creating and substantiating solutions.

Use AI to enhance your understanding and explore different approaches. The goal is learning, not just completing assignments. Engage with AI output critically and use it to deepen your knowledge.

#### 🧠 5. Concept: Understanding Over Output

Programming and coding focus on conceptual understanding, in order to create an optimal solution with AI.

Master the fundamental concepts behind the code. Use AI to explore different design patterns and approaches, but ensure you understand the principles and can explain your choices.

#### 👥 6. Face-to-Face: Authentic Dialogue

To guarantee authenticity and meaning, conversations between teacher and student take place in person.

Your discussions with instructors are AI-free zones. Come prepared to explain your thinking, defend your design choices, and demonstrate your understanding without AI assistance.

#### 🎓 7. Competency: Continuous Learning

All students and teachers are and will remain AI-skilled.

Stay current with AI developments relevant to software development. Learn effective prompting techniques, understand AI limitations, and continuously adapt your AI usage as technology evolves.

## Practical Application in this course

### How This Applies to Your Projects

#### Individual Project

* Use AI to brainstorm project ideas and explore technical approaches
* Document AI usage in your portfolio with reflection on learning outcomes
* Be prepared to explain and defend all aspects of your work in assessments

#### Group Project

* Establish team agreements on AI usage and documentation
* Ensure all team members can explain AI-assisted work
* Include AI usage logs in project documentation

#### Portfolio Development

* Include AI usage logs as evidence of professional development
* Reflect on how AI enhanced your learning for each learning outcome
* Demonstrate growth in AI competency throughout the semester

## Documentation Template

Use this format when documenting AI usage in your work:

**AI Usage Entry**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Date** | When you used AI |
| **Tool** | ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, etc. |
| **Context** | What you were working on |
| **Purpose** | Why you needed AI assistance |
| **Input** | Summary of your prompt/question |
| **Output** | Brief description of AI response |
| **Validation** | How you verified/tested the result |
| **Learning** | What you gained from this interaction |

## Assessment Considerations

* ✓ **Transparency is key:** Documented AI usage is viewed positively as professional practice
* ✓ **Understanding is essential:** You must be able to explain all aspects of your work
* ✓ **Face-to-face demonstrations:** Be prepared to work without AI assistance during assessments
* ✓ **Critical thinking:** Show evidence of validating and improving upon AI suggestions

## Getting Started

1. **Choose your tools:** Explore different AI platforms to find what works for your workflow
2. **Start documenting:** Begin logging your AI usage from the first week
3. **Practice validation:** Always test and verify AI-generated code and designs
4. **Engage critically:** Use AI as a thinking partner, not a replacement for your own analysis
