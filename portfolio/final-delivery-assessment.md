# 📁 Portfolio - Final Delivery & Assessment

Complete your learning journey with your final portfolio submission

**⚠️ Final Submission Requirements:** Submit your final portfolio snapshot here. Always include a complete ZIP file with all your code (exclude binaries) before creating your final snapshot. A Git link alone is never sufficient.

## 📋 What to Submit

Your Final Portfolio Must Include

* **Complete Portfolio Snapshot:** Your final Portflow portfolio showing all learning outcomes
* **Source Code Archive:** ZIP file containing all project code (Individual & Group projects)
* **Documentation:** All analysis, design, and reflection documents
* **Evidence Materials:** Screenshots, videos, or other artifacts demonstrating your work

## 🎯 Assessment Process

**💡 Assessment Overview:** Teachers will review your final portfolio to understand your semester 2 journey and evaluate your readiness for semester 3. This comprehensive review considers all your work, progress, and learning outcomes achievement.

### Final Delivery Presentation

You'll typically be invited for a final delivery presentation with your teachers. This is your opportunity to showcase your work and discuss your learning journey.

**📘 Important Note:** While the final delivery session isn't mandatory, you always have the right to request it. Even if teachers don't deem it necessary, you can ask for this presentation opportunity.

## 📊 Assessment Results

Your semester performance will be summarized with a single assessment grade using the USGO scale:

| Grade | Description    | Requirements & Outcomes                                       |

| S     | Satisfactory   | *At least 'Proficient' on all learning outcomes*            |

| O     | Outstanding    | *Exceptional performance and learning outcomes achievement* |
