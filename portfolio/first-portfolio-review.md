# 🔍 First Portfolio Review

Early feedback session to get your portfolio on track

### 🎯Why This Review Matters

This isn't a formal assessment - it's your chance to get early feedback and prevent weeks of working in the wrong direction. Think of it as a course correction before you're too deep in the semester.

## 📋 What to Expect

### 👥Small Group Setting

You'll work in your project groups with one of the teachers. This creates a safe space for honest feedback and peer learning.

### 🔄 Collaborative

Enough time to look at everyone's work and provide meaningful feedback without rushing.

## 📦 What to Bring

#### Your Portfolio Draft (Whatever You Have)

Don't worry if it's incomplete - that's the point! Bring whatever you've got so far.

#### Your Portflow Collection

Whatever you've added to your portfolio collection - even if it's just the template with some basic info.

#### Your Questions & Concerns

What are you struggling with? What feels unclear? These are exactly the things we want to address.

#### Evidence Examples

Any project work, code, documents, or other artifacts you think might fit in your portfolio.

## 🔄 Review Process

### How We'll Structure the Session

#### 1. Quick Check-In (10 minutes)

Everyone shares where they are and what they're struggling with.

#### 2. Portfolio Walkthroughs (45 minutes)

Each person shows their portfolio for 5-10 minutes, gets feedback from the group.

#### 3. Action Planning and wrap up (20 minutes)

Create specific next steps and clarify any common questions.

## 👀 What We'll Look At

### 🏗️Structure & Organization

* Is your collection description clear?
* Are your evidence items well-organized?
* Does the structure make sense to someone else?

### 🔗Learning Outcome Links

* Can you connect your work to specific LOs?
* Are your connections clear and logical?
* What evidence is missing?

### 💭Reflection Quality

* Are you just describing or actually reflecting?
* Do you explain your choices and reasoning?
* What challenges and learning are you capturing?

## 🔧 Common Issues We'll Address

#### Based on previous semesters, here's what we typically see:

* **"I don't know what to put in my portfolio"** - We'll help you identify evidence from your work
* **"My descriptions are too short/generic"** - We'll work on making them more specific and reflective
* **"I can't connect my work to the learning outcomes"** - We'll practice making these connections explicit
* **"I'm behind on my projects"** - We'll help you focus on what's most important

## 📈 After the Review

#### You'll Leave With:

* Clear next steps for your portfolio
* Specific feedback on what's working and what needs improvement
* Examples from your peers' approaches
* Understanding of how to better connect your work to learning outcomes
* Confidence that you're on the right track (or a clear plan to get there)
