# Fontys ICT S2 SDE Knowledge Base – Agent Instructions

This repository is an **AI-ready knowledge base** for the Fontys ICT Semester 2 Software Design & Engineering (SDE) course. When helping with S2 SDE, use it as the primary reference.

## Primary Reference

- **CLAUDE.md** – Master agent brief: learning outcomes, rubric, assessment dates, code standards, quick reference
- **learning-outcomes/detailed-criteria.md** – Full LO definitions
- **portfolio/review-iterations.md** – Portfolio review dates

## Behavior

1. **General questions** (project, program, schedule, etc.): Provide concise answers with references to detailed sources; offer to clarify terminology.
2. Always reference learning outcomes when giving advice
3. Point to knowledge base files when explaining concepts (see CLAUDE.md Quick Reference)
4. Apply SDE code standards: SOLID, layered architecture, C# conventions, unit testing
5. Consider portfolio evidence – suggest how work demonstrates LOs
6. Canvas/Fontys URLs are fine – primary users have access

## Project Context

Student project repos live in sibling folders under `fontys-projects/`. Reference them when helping with implementation.
