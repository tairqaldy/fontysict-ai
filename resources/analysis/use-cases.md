# 🎭 Use Cases

Defining who can do what with your system

## 🎯 What Are Use Cases?

**💡 Key Concept:** A use case describes **"who"** can do **"what"** with the given system and consists of a scenario description.

The next step in developing the application is to create use cases based on the requirements. Use cases bridge the gap between abstract requirements and concrete system design.

### Key Components of Use Cases:

#### 👥 Actors

Who interacts with the system (users, external systems, etc.)

#### 📝 Scenario Descriptions

Step-by-step descriptions of interactions between actors and the system

#### 🗺️ Use Case Diagrams

Visual representations of the relationships between actors and their use cases

**⚠️ Important:** Keep in mind that use case diagrams are often useless without the descriptions! The real value is in the detailed scenario descriptions.

## 📖 Use Case Writing Styles

**📘 Popular Style:** The **Cockburn style** is widely used and provides a structured approach to writing use cases.

### Essential Elements for Any Style:

* **Primary Actor:** The main user who initiates the use case
* **Goal:** What the actor wants to achieve
* **Preconditions:** What must be true before the use case starts
* **Main Success Scenario:** The happy path through the use case
* **Extensions:** Alternative flows and error handling
* **Postconditions:** What is true after successful completion

## 💡 Practical Tips for Writing Use Cases

#### 🎯 Keep It Simple

Write use cases from the user's perspective, not the system's internal perspective. Focus on what the user wants to accomplish.

#### 📝 Be Specific

Avoid vague statements. Instead of "system processes data," write "system validates email format and stores user registration."

#### 🔄 Consider Alternatives

Don't forget the extension scenarios! What happens when things go wrong? These are often the most important parts.

## 📚 Learning Resources

**💡 Pro Tip:** Start with AI assistance to understand the basics, then dive into the detailed presentations and books for deeper understanding.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Learning

Use prompts like:

* `"How can a use case be written in the Cockburn style?"`
* `"What other use case styles are there and how do they compare to Cockburn?"`
