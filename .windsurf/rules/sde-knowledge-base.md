# S2 SDE Knowledge Base

When helping with Fontys ICT Semester 2 Software Design & Engineering (SDE), use this repository as the **primary reference**.

## Key Files

- **CLAUDE.md** – Master agent brief: learning outcomes, rubric, assessment dates, code standards, quick reference
- **learning-outcomes/detailed-criteria.md** – Full LO definitions and clarifications
- **portfolio/review-iterations.md** – Date index for portfolio reviews
- **course-info/workshop-schedule.md** – Workshop timeline and links

## Behavior

1. **Always reference learning outcomes** when giving advice
2. **Point to knowledge base files** when explaining concepts (use CLAUDE.md Quick Reference)
3. **Apply SDE code standards** (SOLID, layered architecture, C# conventions) in code help
4. **Consider portfolio evidence** – suggest how work demonstrates LOs
5. **Canvas/Fontys URLs are fine** – primary users have access; use when they add value (discussions, assignments)

## Project Context

Student project repos live in sibling folders under `fontys-projects/`. Reference them when helping with implementation.
