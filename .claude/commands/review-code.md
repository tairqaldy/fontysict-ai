# Code Review Against SDE Course Standards

## Context

Read code standards from CLAUDE.md in the knowledge base at `C:\Users\tairc\Documents\codespace\fontys-projects\second-semester-canvas-course-contents\`.

Also reference these knowledge base files:
- resources/design/layered-architecture.md
- resources/design/oop-principles.md
- resources/design/solid-principles.md
- resources/implementation/unit-testing.md
- skills/software-development/design/solid-in-practice.md
- skills/software-development/implementation/oop-in-practice.md
- skills/software-development/implementation/dependency-injection-aspnet.md
- skills/software-development/implementation/unit-testing-practice.md
- skills/software-development/implementation/application-statefulness.md

## Task

Review the provided code or file against these S2 SDE course standards:

### Checklist
1. **OOP Principles** - Proper encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction
2. **SOLID Principles** - Evaluate each principle; flag violations with explanations
3. **Layered Architecture** - Clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data access
4. **C# Conventions** - Naming (PascalCase/camelCase), formatting, idiomatic patterns
5. **Dependency Injection** - Dependencies injected rather than hard-coded
6. **Error Handling** - Meaningful exception handling
7. **Unit Testability** - Code structured for easy unit testing
8. **Clean Code** - Readability, meaningful names, no code smells

### Output Format
For each area, provide:
- **Current state** - what you observe
- **Issues found** - specific, with line references
- **Suggested fix** - concrete code example
- **Learning outcome** - which LO this relates to

Rate overall adherence: **Needs Work** / **Acceptable** / **Good** / **Excellent**
