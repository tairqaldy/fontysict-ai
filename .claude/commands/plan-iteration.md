## Task

Help the student plan their work for a portfolio review iteration.

1. **Determine the iteration** - which iteration are they planning for? (1, 2, 3, or final)
2. **Assess current state** - what learning outcomes already have evidence? What gaps exist?
3. **Prioritize work** - which LOs need the most attention for this iteration?
4. **Create a concrete plan** - specific deliverables broken into actionable tasks
5. **Map deliverables to LOs** - ensure each planned piece of work demonstrates something assessable
6. **Identify risks** - what might block progress? What dependencies exist?
7. **Suggest project work** - which project repos under `C:\Users\tairc\Documents\codespace\fontys-projects\` should they focus on?

Keep the plan realistic for a student workload. Better to do fewer things well than many things poorly. Check the student's existing project repos to understand what work has already been done.
