# Research Document Help (DOT Framework)

## Context

Read from the knowledge base at `C:\Users\tairc\Documents\codespace\fontys-projects\second-semester-canvas-course-contents\`:

## Task

Help the student create or improve a research document for their SDE course using the DOT (Development Oriented Triangulation) Framework.

1. **Identify the research question** - help formulate a clear, answerable question
2. **Select appropriate DOT strategies** - which combination of Library, Field, Lab, Showroom, and Workshop methods suits this research?
3. **Structure the document** using the Fontys research document template
4. **Guide the writing** - help with each section, ensuring practical quality
5. **Connect to the project** - research should directly inform a design or implementation decision
6. **Link to learning outcomes** - identify which LOs this research demonstrates

### DOT Framework Strategies
- **Library:** Literature study, best/good/bad practices, available product analysis
- **Field:** Observation, interview, survey, focus group, problem analysis
- **Lab:** Component test, A/B test, system test, usability test, security test
- **Showroom:** Peer review, expert review, product review
- **Workshop:** Prototyping, brainstorm, co-creation, multi-criteria decision making

Research should use strategies from multiple categories (triangulation) for stronger conclusions.
