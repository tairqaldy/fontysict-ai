# Portfolio Iteration Planning

## Context

Read from the knowledge base (this repo root):
- CLAUDE.md
- portfolio/review-iterations.md (date index: first review, iterations 1–3, final delivery)
- portfolio/first-portfolio-review.md, portfolio/iteration-1.md, portfolio/iteration-2.md, portfolio/iteration-3.md, portfolio/final-delivery-assessment.md
- learning-outcomes/overview.md
- learning-outcomes/detailed-criteria.md
- course-info/assessment.md
- course-info/individual-project.md
- course-info/group-project.md
- skills/professional/planning-iterations.md

## Task

Help the student plan their work for a portfolio review iteration.

1. **Determine the iteration** - which iteration are they planning for? (1, 2, 3, or final)
2. **Assess current state** - what learning outcomes already have evidence? What gaps exist?
3. **Prioritize work** - which LOs need the most attention for this iteration?
4. **Create a concrete plan** - specific deliverables broken into actionable tasks
5. **Map deliverables to LOs** - ensure each planned piece of work demonstrates something assessable
6. **Identify risks** - what might block progress? What dependencies exist?
7. **Suggest project work** - which project repos under fontys-projects/ should they focus on?

Keep the plan realistic for a student workload. Better to do fewer things well than many things poorly. Check the student's existing project repos to understand what work has already been done.
