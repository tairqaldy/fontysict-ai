# Portfolio Review & Guidance

## Context

Read course context from these files in the knowledge base (this repo root):
- CLAUDE.md
- portfolio/portfolio-manual.md
- portfolio/review-iterations.md (date index and links to iterations)
- portfolio/creating-a-portfolio.md
- portfolio/first-portfolio-review.md, portfolio/iteration-1.md, portfolio/iteration-2.md, portfolio/iteration-3.md, portfolio/final-delivery-assessment.md
- learning-outcomes/overview.md
- learning-outcomes/detailed-criteria.md
- course-info/assessment.md

## Task

Help the student with their portfolio for the SDE course. You should:

1. **Check which iteration** the student is currently in (ask if unclear)
2. **Review against learning outcomes** - identify which LOs have evidence and which are gaps
3. **Assess the quality** of portfolio entries against the assessment criteria
4. **Suggest improvements** - what to add, revise, or better demonstrate
5. **Recommend concrete evidence** from their project repos that could strengthen the portfolio
6. **Check reflection quality** - portfolio should show learning process, not just results

The student's project repos are under: fontys-projects/

If the student provides specific portfolio content, review it. Otherwise, ask what they have so far and guide them.
