# ⭐ Extra Project

Showcase additional skills beyond your main projects

**📝 Portfolio Enhancement:** As stated in the learning outcomes, we want you to show us your software development skills in several different projects/contexts. Apart from your Individual Project, we want you to show other work also. There are two main ways of doing so. You can choose either one, or both, whatever you deem useful and/or necessary in your portfolio.

## 🛤️ Two Pathways to Excellence

### 1🛠️ Workshop Extensions

During the workshops you get a lot of small assignments. You work on these alone or in a group. You can use these assignments as a starting point, and elaborate on these. Show more of your capabilities.

#### How It Works:

✓Take workshop assignments as your foundation

✓Expand them to showcase additional capabilities

✓Use these projects in your portfolio to demonstrate learning outcomes

**💡 Pro Tip:** These little projects can then be used in your portfolio to show your knowledge on the learning outcomes. Don't just complete the basic assignment - add your own creative touch!

### 2🚀 Extra Assignment Challenge

If you think you don't need the workshops, you will not have enough material in your portfolio. So we require an extra assignment from you. You can execute it in your own time during the semester, and to the extent that is necessary for your portfolio.

**⚠️ Important Requirement:** If you skip workshops, this extra assignment becomes mandatory to ensure your portfolio has sufficient breadth and depth.

#### Assignment Characteristics:

✓Follow the complete software life cycle

✓Parts can be shortened/simplified to focus on portfolio needs

✓Self-paced execution during the semester

✓Scaled to the extent necessary for your portfolio

**📚 Resource Available:** See [Extra Challenges](../extra/README.md) for specific challenge options and guidance.

### 🎓 Essential Guidance

**Remember:** Make sure you discuss and ask feedback on the choice of the assignment, and the approach you are taking with your coach(es). Regular consultation ensures you're on the right track and maximizing the value for your portfolio.
